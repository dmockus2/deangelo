This project verifies that the homicides reported in the [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html "Compressed Mortality File") exclude foreign resident deaths.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
 [] Restricted access mortality data (alternatively, since the totals are national, you could use [public use mortality data](https://data.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-mortality-data-multiple-cause-of-death.html "from the NBER")
 [] Take a look at the folder structure in the `data` folder to make sure your data is in the right places.
 
## run.do
The only code you need to edit will be `run.do`.
